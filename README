EGS is a GNU AGPL Erlang Game Server for the game Phantasy Star Universe: AOTI.

This is a community effort toward reviving the now dead western PC servers.
Ultimately the goal is to provide common components for instanced action
RPG game servers, by providing facilities to handle characters, items,
communication aspects, and more. A later goal could be to research a new
and optimized protocol and build an associated client.

The project is in progress and does not include data files. 
Users cannot run a server without proprietary files from AOTI

The server requires Erlang R14B to compile and run.

Use 'make' to compile, 'make run' to run and 'make fclean' to cleanup.
